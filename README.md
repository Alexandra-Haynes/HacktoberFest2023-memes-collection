   "id": <unique-id>,
   "path": "<path-to-your-meme>"
   }
   ```

   Make sure to replace `<unique-id>` and `<path-to-your-meme>` with the appropriate values.
   Place your meme image in the `src/memes/` folder with the same name as the path value in the `MemesCollection.json` file.

- For Jokes:
     Add your joke to the `src/JokesCollection.json` file in the following format:

   ```markdown
   { "id": <unique-id> , "joke": "<your-joke>", "contributor": "<your-name>" }
