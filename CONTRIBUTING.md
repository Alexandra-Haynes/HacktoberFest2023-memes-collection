## How to Contribute

1. **Fork & Clone**: If you haven’t already, fork the project, then clone your fork locally.

2. **Branch**: Create a new branch based on the `main` branch. Use a branch name that briefly tells what your contribution is about, e.g., `add-new-meme` or `fix-typo-in-readme`.

3. **Add Meme/Joke**:
    - For memes: Save your meme image in the `static/images/` folder. Accepted file formats are `.png` and `.jpg`.
    - For jokes: Write your joke in a new markdown file inside the `content/` folder.

4. **Commit**: Commit your changes. Use a clear and meaningful commit message.

5. **Push**: Push your changes to your GitHub repository.

6. **Pull Request**: Go to your fork on GitHub and create a new pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure that your PR doesn’t have any merge conflicts.
